"""The roller is fair, and every roll it makes can be replayed.

Trust is the product here. A combat engine can assert that its dice were
fair; a module that ships its RNG, its fairness tests and its seed can prove
it. These are the tests that make the claim checkable.

Every test is SEEDED and therefore deterministic -- a fairness test that
fails once a fortnight teaches people to re-run CI, which is worse than not
having it. The seeds below are arbitrary but fixed; the critical values are
standard.
